# Web Games Collection

This repository contains simple web implementations of six classic games:

- **Tetris**
- **Snake**
- **Minesweeper**
- **Poker Solitaire**
- **Flappy Bird**
- **3D Pong**

Each game lives inside the `games/` directory with its own HTML and JavaScript files. A simple landing page is provided at the repository root to help you choose a game quickly.

## Running the Games

The easiest way to try the games is to visit the project page on GitHub Pages:

```
https://ijij6960.github.io/self_ai/
```

From there you can select a game to play. If you prefer, you can also open the individual game files locally:

```
./games/tetris/index.html
./games/snake/index.html
./games/minesweeper/index.html
./games/poker-solitaire/index.html
./games/flappy-bird/index.html
./games/3d-pong/index.html
```

Simply load the file and play!
